# Sprint 2 Enhancement Proposals
## Minecraft Server Manager

**Date:** January 9, 2025  
**Status:** Proposal Phase  
**Target Sprint:** 09-2025_SPRINT_2

---

## Overview

This document outlines 5 incremental enhancement proposals for the Minecraft Server Manager application. Each proposal is designed to be implementable within 1-2 sprints while maintaining application stability and providing meaningful improvements to user experience, functionality, or system capabilities.

The current application is in a stable state with comprehensive server management, user administration, process monitoring, and security features. These proposals focus on enhancing existing capabilities rather than introducing major architectural changes.

## Proposal 1: Real-Time Server Console Integration

### Rationale
The current console functionality shows only sample/placeholder data. Users need real-time access to actual server logs and console output for effective server management, debugging, and monitoring.

### Technical Description
- **Backend Changes:**
  - Create new API endpoint `/api/console/<server_id>/logs` to stream server log files
  - Implement log file parsing to extract timestamp, level, and message components
  - Add WebSocket support for real-time log streaming (optional enhancement)
  - Create console command execution endpoint `/api/console/<server_id>/command` for sending commands to running servers

- **Frontend Changes:**
  - Replace sample data in `loadConsoleLogs()` with actual API calls
  - Implement real-time log streaming with auto-scroll functionality
  - Add command input field for sending console commands
  - Enhance log filtering by level (INFO, WARN, ERROR) and time range

- **Files to Modify:**
  - `app/routes/api/` (new API routes)
  - `app/templates/base.html` (console JavaScript)
  - `app/static/css/style.css` (console styling)
  - `app/utils.py` (log parsing utilities)

### Implementation Effort
- **Sprint 1:** Basic log reading and display
- **Sprint 2:** Real-time streaming and command execution

## Proposal 2: Enhanced Server Analytics Dashboard

### Rationale
While basic monitoring exists, users need comprehensive analytics to understand server performance, resource usage patterns, and player activity trends over time.

### Technical Description
- **Backend Changes:**
  - Extend `app/monitoring.py` to collect historical metrics data
  - Create new database tables for storing time-series metrics (CPU, memory, player count, TPS)
  - Implement data aggregation functions for different time ranges (hourly, daily, weekly)
  - Add new API endpoints for analytics data retrieval

- **Frontend Changes:**
  - Enhance the existing analytics modal with real charts using Chart.js
  - Add multiple chart types: line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, pie charts for resource distribution
  - Implement time range selectors and data export functionality
  - Create server comparison views for multi-server environments

- **Database Schema:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE server_metrics (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      server_id INTEGER,
      timestamp DATETIME,
      cpu_usage REAL,
      memory_usage REAL,
      player_count INTEGER,
      tps REAL,
      FOREIGN KEY (server_id) REFERENCES server (id)
  );
  ```

### Implementation Effort
- **Sprint 1:** Data collection and basic charts
- **Sprint 2:** Advanced analytics and comparison features

## Proposal 3: Automated Backup Scheduling System

### Rationale
Current backup functionality requires manual intervention. Users need automated, scheduled backups with retention policies to ensure data safety without constant monitoring.

### Technical Description
- **Backend Changes:**
  - Create new `app/backup_scheduler.py` module for managing backup schedules
  - Implement cron-like scheduling using APScheduler library
  - Add backup retention policies (keep last N backups, delete older than X days)
  - Create backup verification system to ensure backup integrity
  - Add backup compression and encryption options

- **Database Schema:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE backup_schedules (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      server_id INTEGER,
      schedule_type VARCHAR(20), -- 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly'
      schedule_time TIME,
      retention_days INTEGER,
      enabled BOOLEAN,
      last_backup DATETIME,
      FOREIGN KEY (server_id) REFERENCES server (id)
  );
  ```

- **UI Changes:**
  - Add backup scheduling interface in server configuration
  - Create backup history view showing all backups with status
  - Add backup restore functionality with server selection

- **Files to Modify:**
  - `app/routes/server_routes.py` (backup endpoints)
  - `app/templates/configure_server.html` (scheduling UI)
  - `scripts/backup.py` (enhanced backup script)

### Implementation Effort
- **Sprint 1:** Basic scheduling and retention
- **Sprint 2:** Advanced features and UI integration

## Proposal 4: Server Template System

### Rationale
Users often create similar servers with common configurations. A template system would save time and ensure consistency across server setups.

### Technical Description
- **Backend Changes:**
  - Create new `ServerTemplate` model for storing reusable configurations
  - Add template management API endpoints (create, update, delete, apply)
  - Implement template validation to ensure compatibility with different Minecraft versions
  - Add template sharing capabilities between users (admin-only initially)

- **Database Schema:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE server_templates (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100),
      description TEXT,
      minecraft_version VARCHAR(20),
      server_properties TEXT, -- JSON configuration
      plugins TEXT, -- JSON list of plugins
      world_seed VARCHAR(100),
      created_by INTEGER,
      is_public BOOLEAN,
      created_at DATETIME,
      FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES user (id)
  );
  ```

- **UI Changes:**
  - Add "Create from Template" option in server creation flow
  - Create template management interface for admins
  - Add template preview showing configuration details
  - Implement template import/export functionality

- **Files to Modify:**
  - `app/models.py` (new ServerTemplate model)
  - `app/routes/server_routes.py` (template endpoints)
  - `app/templates/select_version.html` (template selection)

### Implementation Effort
- **Sprint 1:** Basic template creation and application
- **Sprint 2:** Advanced features and sharing capabilities

## Proposal 5: Mobile-Responsive UI Enhancement

### Rationale
The current UI is functional but not optimized for mobile devices. With the increasing use of mobile devices for server management, a responsive design would significantly improve user experience.

### Technical Description
- **Frontend Changes:**
  - Implement responsive design patterns using Bootstrap 4's grid system
  - Create mobile-specific navigation (hamburger menu, collapsible panels)
  - Optimize server cards for touch interaction (larger buttons, swipe gestures)
  - Add mobile-specific console interface with touch-friendly controls
  - Implement progressive web app (PWA) features for offline capability

- **CSS Enhancements:**
  - Add media queries for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Create mobile-specific styles for modals and forms
  - Implement touch-friendly button sizing and spacing
  - Add mobile-optimized data tables with horizontal scrolling

- **JavaScript Enhancements:**
  - Add touch event handlers for mobile interactions
  - Implement pull-to-refresh functionality
  - Add mobile-specific console controls (virtual keyboard support)
  - Create mobile-optimized bulk operations interface

- **Files to Modify:**
  - `app/templates/base.html` (responsive layout)
  - `app/templates/home.html` (mobile-optimized server cards)
  - `app/static/css/style.css` (responsive styles)
  - `app/static/js/` (mobile interactions)

### Implementation Effort
- **Sprint 1:** Basic responsive layout and mobile navigation
- **Sprint 2:** Advanced mobile features and PWA capabilities
