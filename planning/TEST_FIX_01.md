## Implementation Strategy

### Approach

1. **Surgical Changes**: Implement the smallest possible changes to fix each issue
2. **Incremental Progress**: Complete tasks in priority order, testing after each phase
3. **Isolation**: Ensure fixes don't introduce new failures
4. **Documentation**: Document any changes made to test infrastructure

### Testing Strategy

1. Run tests after each task completion
2. Focus on eliminating specific error categories
3. Maintain test isolation and independence
4. Ensure no regression in passing tests

### Success Metrics

- **Target**: 100% test pass rate (185/185 tests passing)
- **Current**: 60% test pass rate (111/185 tests passing)
- **Improvement**: 40% increase in test reliability

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks

1. **Breaking Changes**: Fixes might introduce new test failures
2. **Test Isolation**: Changes might affect test independence
3. **Performance**: Test execution time might increase
4. **Maintenance**: Test infrastructure changes might be complex

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Incremental Testing**: Test after each change
2. **Backup Strategy**: Keep original test files as reference
3. **Documentation**: Document all changes made
4. **Validation**: Ensure fixes don't break existing functionality

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 9-13 hours (Critical Infrastructure)
- **Phase 2**: 5-7 hours (Error Handling)
- **Phase 3**: 4-6 hours (Configuration)
- **Phase 4**: 3-5 hours (Assertions)
- **Phase 5**: 3-5 hours (Security)
- **Phase 6**: 5-7 hours (Integration)

**Total Estimated Time**: 29-43 hours

## Conclusion

This plan provides a structured approach to fixing the failing test suite. By addressing issues in priority order and implementing surgical changes, we can achieve a fully passing test suite while maintaining code quality and test reliability. The plan is designed to be executed by a single engineer and provides clear acceptance criteria for each task.

Each task is bite-sized and can be completed independently, allowing for incremental progress and easy tracking of improvements. The focus on surgical changes ensures that we don't introduce new issues while fixing existing ones.
