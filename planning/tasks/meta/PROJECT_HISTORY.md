Created comprehensive development environment management script (`dev.sh`) with automatic port conflict detection, virtual environment activation, dependency installation, and environment variable management. The script handles multiple development instances gracefully by finding available ports and provides options for different development modes (debug, test, production). Includes proper error handling, colored output, and supports both Python Flask app and frontend development workflows.
