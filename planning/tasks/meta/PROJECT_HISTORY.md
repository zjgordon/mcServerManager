## 2025-01-09 - CARD-001: Create dev.sh development environment management script

**Epic:** Epic 1 – Repository Organization and Environment Setup  
**Status:** Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  

Created comprehensive development environment management script (`dev.sh`) with automatic port conflict detection, virtual environment activation, dependency installation, and environment variable management. The script handles multiple development instances gracefully by finding available ports and provides options for different development modes (debug, test, production). Includes proper error handling, colored output, and supports both Python Flask app and frontend development workflows.

## 2025-01-09 - CARD-002: Create .env.example template with all required variables

**Epic:** Epic 1 – Repository Organization and Environment Setup  
**Status:** Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  

Created comprehensive `.env.example` template file documenting all environment variables from `app/config.py` with detailed comments explaining each variable's purpose. Includes security configuration (SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL), Flask settings (FLASK_ENV, FLASK_DEBUG), application settings (APP_TITLE, SERVER_HOSTNAME), memory management variables, and security settings. Template uses proper shell-safe format with quoted values and includes setup instructions for developers to copy and customize for their environment.

## 2025-01-09 - CARD-003: Pin all dependencies to specific versions in requirements.txt

**Epic:** Epic 1 – Repository Organization and Environment Setup  
**Status:** Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  

Organized and enhanced `requirements.txt` with all dependencies pinned to exact versions for reproducible builds. Added comprehensive comments grouping dependencies by category: Core Flask Framework, Flask Dependencies & Utilities, Database & ORM, HTTP & Network, Security & Authentication, System Utilities, and Type Hints. Created backup file `requirements-pinned.txt` and verified all dependencies install correctly with the development environment script. Ensures consistent dependency versions across development and production environments.

## 2025-01-09 - CARD-004: Create requirements-dev.txt for development dependencies

**Epic:** Epic 1 – Repository Organization and Environment Setup  
**Status:** Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  

Created comprehensive `requirements-dev.txt` file with all development tools pinned to exact versions for reproducible builds. Includes testing frameworks (pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-flask), code formatting tools (black, isort, flake8), type checking (mypy, types-requests), security tools (bandit), pre-commit hooks, documentation tools (pydocstyle, markdown), and advanced testing (hypothesis). Resolved dependency conflicts by selecting compatible versions and verified successful installation. Provides developers with all necessary tools for code quality, testing, and security analysis.

## 2025-01-09 - CARD-005: Organize project directory structure for scalable development

**Epic:** Epic 1 – Repository Organization and Environment Setup  
**Status:** Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  

Organized project directory structure by creating dedicated directories for different types of files: `scripts/` for development utilities, `config/` for configuration files, `docs/` for documentation, and `logs/` for application logs. Moved existing configuration files (`config.example.json`, `.env.example`, `pytest.ini`) to the `config/` directory and added `.gitkeep` files to maintain empty directories in version control. Set proper permissions on the `logs/` directory and ensured all existing functionality remains intact. This structure provides better organization for scalable development and clearer separation of concerns.

## 2025-01-09 - CARD-005A: Fix SQLAlchemy Session Management in Test Fixtures

**Epic:** Epic 1 – Test Suite Reliability  
**Status:** Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  

Fixed critical SQLAlchemy session management issue in test fixtures that was causing DetachedInstanceError exceptions in 20+ tests. The problem occurred when Server objects became detached from the database session after fixture creation. Implemented surgical fix by adding `db.session.refresh(server)` call in the `test_server` fixture after commit to ensure proper session binding throughout test lifecycle. This eliminates database session leaks between tests and ensures Server objects remain bound to session. The fix affects only test infrastructure and does not impact application code.

## 2025-01-09 - CARD-005B: Fix Authentication Test Infrastructure and Session Management

**Epic:** Epic 1 – Test Suite Reliability  
**Status:** Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  

Fixed authentication test infrastructure issues that were causing redirect problems and session management failures. The core issue was that the `check_admin_setup()` before_request handler was redirecting to admin setup when no admin user with password existed, preventing login page from loading in tests. Implemented surgical fix by modifying the `app` fixture to automatically create a default admin user during test setup, ensuring admin setup redirects don't interfere with test flow. Also updated the `admin_user` fixture to reuse existing admin user to prevent UNIQUE constraint violations. This ensures session management works correctly across test boundaries and flash messages are properly captured and asserted.
