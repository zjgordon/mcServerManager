title: Remove unnecessary hooks and simplify pre-commit configuration
epic: Epic 7 â€“ Development Workflow Optimization
sprint: 09-2025_SPRINT_1
status: todo
owner: cursor
links: []
acceptance:
  - Remove pydocstyle hook (documentation standards not critical)
  - Remove mypy hook (type checking overhead for rapid development)
  - Remove safety hook (dependency scanning not critical for gaming app)
  - Remove bandit hook (security scanning overkill for Minecraft server)
  - Keep only essential hooks: black, isort, flake8, basic file quality
  - Pre-commit configuration reduced from 25+ hooks to ~8 essential hooks
  - Update planning/meta/PROJECT_HISTORY.md with log entry
  - Update meta/PROJECT_STATUS.md with one-liner
  - Commit follows Conventional Commits with [CARD-024]
artifacts:
  - .pre-commit-config.yaml (simplified)
  - requirements-dev.txt (updated if needed)
notes: |
  This card removes hooks that are inappropriate for a Minecraft server
  management application, focusing on development velocity over perfect
  formatting and security.
  
  Hooks to remove:
  - pydocstyle: Documentation standards not critical for server management
  - mypy: Type checking overhead for rapid development cycles
  - safety: Dependency scanning not critical for gaming application
  - bandit: Security scanning overkill for Minecraft server management
  
  Keep essential hooks:
  - black, isort, flake8: Core Python formatting and basic linting
  - Basic file quality hooks: trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, etc.
  
  This creates a more appropriate configuration for rapid development
  and "vibe-coding" methodology.
