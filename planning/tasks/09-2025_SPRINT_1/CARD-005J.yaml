links: []
acceptance:
  - All security validation tests pass
  - Regex patterns work correctly
  - File upload validation works as expected
  - CSRF protection tests pass
  - Security policies work correctly in test environment
artifacts:
  - Fixed regex patterns in security validation tests
  - Updated file upload validation test expectations

notes: |
  This card fixes security test assertion issues:
  
  1. Security validation tests failing
  2. Regex pattern matching not working correctly
  3. File upload validation tests failing
  4. CSRF protection tests not working
  
  The solution involves:
  - Fixing regex patterns in security validation tests
  - Updating file upload validation test expectations
  - Fixing CSRF protection test setup
  - Ensuring security policies work correctly in test environment
  
  Files affected: tests/test_security_improvements.py, tests/test_security.py
  
  This is a surgical fix focused on test assertion accuracy
  without changing application security policies or validation logic.
