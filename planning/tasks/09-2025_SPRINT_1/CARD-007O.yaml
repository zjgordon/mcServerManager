notes: |
  Re-enable the detect-secrets security hook that was temporarily disabled due to version compatibility issues:
  - Uncomment the detect-secrets hook section in .pre-commit-config.yaml
  - Update detect-secrets to latest compatible version
  - Resolve any dependency conflicts
  - Create or update .secrets.baseline file if needed
  - Test the hook with pre-commit run detect-secrets --all-files
  - Address any secret detection findings if they appear
  
  Ensure the hook runs successfully without breaking the pre-commit pipeline.
  Run pre-commit to verify the hook works before committing.
