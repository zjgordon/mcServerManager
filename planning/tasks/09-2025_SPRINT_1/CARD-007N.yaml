  Re-enable the pydocstyle documentation hook that was temporarily disabled due to missing docstrings:
  - Uncomment the pydocstyle hook section in .pre-commit-config.yaml
  - Update pydocstyle to latest compatible version
  - Resolve any dependency conflicts
  - Test the hook with pre-commit run pydocstyle --all-files
  - Address any documentation style issues that appear
  
  Ensure the hook runs successfully without breaking the pre-commit pipeline.
  Run pre-commit to verify the hook works before committing.
