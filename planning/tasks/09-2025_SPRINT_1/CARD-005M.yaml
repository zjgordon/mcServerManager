status: todo
owner: cursor
links: []
acceptance:
  - All memory management tests pass
  - Memory calculations work correctly
  - Memory validation functions properly
  - Memory allocation works as expected
  - Memory usage summary tests pass
artifacts:
  - Fixed memory calculation logic in tests
  - Updated memory validation test expectations
  - Test execution results showing passing memory management tests
notes: |
  This card fixes memory management test issues:
  
  1. Memory calculation tests failing
  2. Memory validation tests not working
  3. Memory allocation tests failing
  4. Memory usage summary tests failing
  
  The solution involves:
  - Fixing memory calculation logic in tests
  - Updating memory validation test expectations
  - Ensuring proper memory allocation in test environment
  - Fixing memory usage summary tests
  
  Files affected: tests/test_memory_management.py
  
  This is a surgical fix focused on test accuracy for memory management
  without changing application memory handling or allocation logic.
