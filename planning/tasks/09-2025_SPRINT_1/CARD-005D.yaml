title: Fix Custom Exception Handling in Tests
epic: Epic 1 â€“ Test Suite Reliability
sprint: 09-2025_SPRINT_1

acceptance:
  - All custom exceptions raise correctly in tests
  - Test assertions match actual exception behavior
  - Error handling decorators work correctly in test environment
  - No exception type mismatches in test expectations
  - All affected tests pass with proper exception handling
artifacts:
  - Updated utility functions with proper exception raising
  - Modified test assertions to match actual exception types
  - Test execution results showing proper exception handling
notes: |
  This card fixes custom exception handling issues in the test suite:
  
  1. Custom exceptions not being raised as expected
  2. Error handling decorators interfering with test assertions
  3. Exception type mismatches in test expectations
  
  The solution involves:
  - Reviewing and fixing exception raising in utility functions
  - Updating test assertions to match actual exception types
  - Fixing error handling decorators to not interfere with test flow
  - Ensuring proper exception propagation in test environment
  
  Files affected: tests/test_utils.py, tests/test_error_handling.py
  
  This is a surgical fix focused on ensuring exceptions work correctly in tests
  without changing the application's error handling behavior.
