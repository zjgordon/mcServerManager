  Fix markdown line length issues (MD013) exceeding 80 characters in remaining files:
  - PROCESS_MANAGEMENT.md: Lines 3, 19, 20, 21, 32 (172, 120, 127, 100, 105 > 80 characters)
  - docs/configuration.md: Lines 3, 7, 9, 17, 79, 133 (186, 94, 103, 114, 87, 168 > 80 characters)
  - docs/pre-commit-setup.md: Lines 5, 9, 121, 123, 125, 127, 156, 158 (206, 111, 113, 134, 117, 100, 99, 88 > 80 characters)
  
  Break long lines at appropriate points while maintaining readability.
  Use markdown line breaks or restructure content as needed.
  Run markdownlint to verify fixes before committing.
