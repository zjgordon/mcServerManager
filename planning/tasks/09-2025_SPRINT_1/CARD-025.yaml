acceptance:
  - Run pre-commit on all files successfully
  - Verify Python files pass new 100-character line length
  - Test documentation commits work without markdown linting issues
  - Verify flake8 passes with new ignore patterns
  - Test commit process works smoothly for typical development tasks
  - Document any remaining issues or edge cases
  - Update planning/meta/PROJECT_HISTORY.md with log entry
  - Update meta/PROJECT_STATUS.md with one-liner

  Phase 2: Testing and Validation (1 day)
  
  This card thoroughly tests the simplified pre-commit configuration to
  ensure it works correctly and provides the intended development experience.
  
  Test scenarios:
  - Run pre-commit --all-files on entire codebase
  - Test typical Python development commits
  - Test documentation updates (README, CHANGELOG, etc.)
  - Verify no false positives from overly strict rules
  - Test edge cases and long lines that previously caused issues
  
  Expected outcomes:
  - Faster commit times
  - Fewer pre-commit failures
  - Better development experience for agents
  - Maintained code quality standards appropriate for the application
