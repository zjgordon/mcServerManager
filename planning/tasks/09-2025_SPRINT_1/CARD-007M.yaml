notes: |
  Re-enable the bandit security hook that was temporarily disabled due to dependency issues:
  - Uncomment the bandit hook section in .pre-commit-config.yaml
  - Update bandit to latest compatible version
  - Resolve any dependency conflicts
  - Test the hook with pre-commit run bandit --all-files
  - Address any new security findings if they appear
  
  Ensure the hook runs successfully without breaking the pre-commit pipeline.
  Run pre-commit to verify the hook works before committing.
