title: Fix Status Code Assertions in Tests
epic: Epic 1 â€“ Test Suite Reliability
sprint: 09-2025_SPRINT_1
status: todo
owner: cursor
links: []
acceptance:
  - All status code assertions pass
  - Redirect behavior properly handled
  - Authentication flow works correctly in tests
  - No false negatives in status code tests
  - Test expectations match actual HTTP behavior
artifacts:
  - Updated status code expectations to match actual behavior
  - Fixed redirect handling in test requests
  - Test execution results showing passing status code tests
notes: |
  This card fixes status code assertion issues in the test suite:
  
  1. Status code assertions failing (expecting 200, getting 302)
  2. Redirect behavior not properly handled in tests
  3. Authentication redirects interfering with test expectations
  
  The solution involves:
  - Updating status code expectations to match actual behavior
  - Fixing redirect handling in test requests
  - Ensuring proper authentication flow in tests
  - Updating test assertions to account for redirect behavior
  
  Files affected: tests/test_auth.py, tests/test_server_routes.py, tests/test_security.py
  
  This is a surgical fix focused on test assertion accuracy
  without changing application HTTP behavior or redirect logic.
