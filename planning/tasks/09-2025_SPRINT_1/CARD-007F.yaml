  Fix shellcheck issues in dev.sh:
  - Line 197: Variable 'mode' is assigned but never used (SC2034)
  
  Either remove the unused variable or implement its intended functionality.
  Review the script logic to determine if the variable was meant to be used.
  Run shellcheck to verify the fix before committing.
