  Fix duplicate headings (MD024) in markdown files:
  - CHANGELOG.md: Multiple headings with same content "### Added", "### Changed", "### Fixed"
  - planning/SPRINT1-SAFE_COMMITS.md: Multiple headings with same content "#### Tasks", "#### Deliverables"
  
  Rename duplicate headings to be unique while maintaining logical structure.
  Consider using version numbers, dates, or descriptive suffixes to differentiate.
  Run markdownlint to verify fixes before committing.
