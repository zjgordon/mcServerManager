  Fix first-line heading issues (MD041) in markdown files:
  - planning/tasks/meta/PROJECT_HISTORY.md: Add top-level heading as first line
  - planning/tasks/meta/PROJECT_STATUS.md: Add top-level heading as first line
  
  Add appropriate H1 headings (# Title) as the first line of each file.
  Ensure the headings are descriptive and follow markdown best practices.
  Run markdownlint to verify fixes before committing.
