  Phase 3: Documentation Updates (2 hours)
  
  This card updates all development documentation to reflect the new
  pre-commit standards and provides clear guidance for the development team.
  
  Documentation updates:
  - Update pre-commit setup documentation
  - Update contributing guidelines with new standards
  - Create development workflow documentation
  - Document bypass procedures for specific cases
  - Update any README references to old standards
  
  Bypass procedures to document:
  - Documentation commits: git commit --no-verify
  - Rapid prototyping: git commit --no-verify
  - Emergency fixes: git commit --no-verify
  
  This ensures the team understands the new standards and has clear
  procedures for when bypasses are appropriate.
