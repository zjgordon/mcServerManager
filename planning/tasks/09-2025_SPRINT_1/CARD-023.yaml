acceptance:
  - Black configuration updated to 100 character line length
  - isort configuration updated to 100 character line length
  - flake8 configuration updated to 100 character line length
  - All Python files pass new line length standards
  - Configuration consistency verified across all tools
  - Update planning/meta/PROJECT_HISTORY.md with log entry
  - Update meta/PROJECT_STATUS.md with one-liner
  - Commit follows Conventional Commits with [CARD-023]
artifacts:
  - pyproject.toml (line length updates)
  - .pre-commit-config.yaml (line length updates)
notes: |
  This card ensures consistent line length standards across all Python
  formatting and linting tools.
  
  Specific updates:
  - [tool.black] line-length = 100
  - [tool.isort] line_length = 100
  - flake8 max-line-length = 100
  - Verify all Python files comply with new standards
  
  This eliminates the line length conflicts that have been causing issues
  for agents and creates a more reasonable standard for Minecraft server
  management code (which often involves long configuration strings and
  server names).
