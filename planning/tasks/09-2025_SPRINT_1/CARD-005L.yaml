epic: Epic 1 â€“ Test Suite Reliability
sprint: 09-2025_SPRINT_1
status: todo
owner: cursor
links: []
acceptance:
  - All integration workflow tests pass
  - Multi-user scenarios work correctly
  - Error recovery workflows function properly
  - Data persistence works as expected
  - Test isolation maintained in integration tests
artifacts:
  - Fixed workflow test setup and teardown
  - Updated integration test configurations
  - Test execution results showing passing integration tests

  This card fixes integration test workflow issues:
  
  1. Complete workflow tests failing
  2. Multi-user workflow tests not working
  3. Error recovery workflow tests failing
  4. Data persistence workflow tests failing
  
  The solution involves:
  - Fixing workflow test setup and teardown
  - Ensuring proper test isolation in integration tests
  - Fixing multi-user test scenarios
  - Updating error recovery test expectations
  
  Files affected: tests/test_integration.py, tests/test_memory_management.py
  
  This is a surgical fix focused on test workflow reliability
  without changing application business logic or workflows.
