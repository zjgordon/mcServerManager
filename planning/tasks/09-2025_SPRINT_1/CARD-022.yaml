  Phase 1: Immediate Relief (1-2 hours)
  
  This card implements the most critical changes to provide immediate relief
  from pre-commit friction:
  
  Changes:
  - Python line length: 88 → 100 characters
  - Remove markdownlint hook (major source of documentation friction)
  - Add E501, F401 to flake8 ignore patterns
  - Remove detect-secrets and semgrep hooks
  - Update pyproject.toml to match new line length standards
  
  This addresses the core issue of agents being stumped by simple line length
  issues and creates a more development-friendly environment for the Minecraft
  server management application.
