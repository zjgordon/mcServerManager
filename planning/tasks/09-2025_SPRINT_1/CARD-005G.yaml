links: []
acceptance:
  - No test data leakage between tests
  - Port allocation tests run independently
  - File system operations properly mocked
  - Test data properly cleaned up between tests
  - All affected tests pass with proper isolation
artifacts:
  - Updated test fixtures with proper cleanup
  - Fixed port allocation test isolation
  - Improved file system operation mocking
  - Test execution results showing proper isolation

  This card fixes test data setup and cleanup issues:
  
  1. Test data not properly cleaned up between tests
  2. Port allocation tests interfering with each other
  3. File system operations not properly mocked
  
  The solution involves:
  - Implementing proper test data cleanup in fixtures
  - Fixing port allocation test isolation
  - Improving file system operation mocking
  - Ensuring test independence
  
  Files affected: tests/test_memory_management.py, tests/test_integration.py, tests/test_utils.py
  
  This is a surgical fix focused on test isolation and cleanup
  without changing application logic or data handling.
