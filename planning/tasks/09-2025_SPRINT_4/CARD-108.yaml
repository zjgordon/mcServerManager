  **Objective**: Create a new develop branch from the updated main branch to begin work on the next sprint features.

  **Prerequisites**:
  - Main branch has been updated with v0.2.0-alpha release (CARD-107)
  - All changes are properly merged and pushed

  **Branch Creation Process**:
  1. Ensure on main branch: `git checkout main`
  2. Pull latest main: `git pull origin main`
  3. Create new develop branch: `git checkout -b develop`
  4. Push new develop branch: `git push -u origin develop`
  5. Verify branch creation and setup

  **Branch Configuration**:
  - Set upstream tracking: `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/develop develop`
  - Verify tracking is correct: `git branch -vv`
  - Ensure develop is ahead of main by default

  **Branch Setup Verification**:
  - Confirm develop branch exists locally and remotely
  - Verify develop is tracking origin/develop
  - Ensure develop contains all main branch changes
  - Test that new commits can be made on develop

  **Technical Requirements**:
  - Create branch from latest main commit
  - Set up proper upstream tracking
  - Push branch to remote repository
  - Verify branch is ready for development

  **Validation**:
  - Confirm develop branch exists and is current
  - Verify tracking configuration is correct
  - Ensure branch is ready for new feature development
  - Test branch switching and pushing capabilities

  **Next Steps**:
  - This new develop branch will be used for implementing the Console Commands features
  - All new development work should be done on this develop branch
  - Future releases will follow the same merge process
