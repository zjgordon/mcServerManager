  **Objective**: Merge the develop branch into the main branch to publish the v0.2.0-alpha release.

  **Prerequisites**:
  - Git tag v0.2.0-alpha created (CARD-106)
  - All tests passing on develop branch
  - Code is in stable, releasable state

  **Merge Process**:
  1. Switch to main branch: `git checkout main`
  2. Pull latest main: `git pull origin main`
  3. Merge develop into main: `git merge develop`
  4. Push main branch: `git push origin main`
  5. Verify merge was successful

  **Merge Strategy**:
  - Use regular merge (not fast-forward) to preserve branch history
  - Create merge commit with descriptive message
  - Ensure all changes from develop are included in main

  **Merge Commit Message**:
  ```
  Merge develop into main for v0.2.0-alpha release

  This merge brings all development work from the develop branch
  into main for the v0.2.0-alpha release, including:
  - Server Management Page implementation
  - Enhanced test suite capabilities
  - Experimental features system
  - Comprehensive backup scheduling
  - Memory management improvements

  Tag: v0.2.0-alpha
  ```

  **Technical Requirements**:
  - Ensure clean working directory before merge
  - Verify no conflicts exist between branches
  - Use proper merge commit message
  - Push changes to remote repository
  - Verify merge was successful

  **Validation**:
  - Confirm main branch contains all develop changes
  - Verify git log shows proper merge commit
  - Ensure remote main branch is updated
  - Test that main branch is in working state
