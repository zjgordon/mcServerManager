notes: |
  Remove the dummy experimental feature cards (advanced_monitoring, auto_backup, multi_user, plugin_manager) 
  from app/templates/admin_config.html lines 151-239. Replace with a single "Server Management Page" 
  feature card that is experimental and disabled by default. This prepares the system for the real 
  server management page feature flag.
