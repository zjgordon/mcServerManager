notes: |
  Add a new route @server_bp.route("/manage/<int:server_id>") to app/routes/server_routes.py. 
  Use existing check_server_access() function for access control. Add feature flag check using 
  is_feature_enabled('server_management_page'). If feature disabled, redirect to home with flash message.
  Route should be GET only and render server_management.html template.
