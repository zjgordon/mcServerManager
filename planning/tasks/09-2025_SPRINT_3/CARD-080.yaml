  Add execute_server_command(server_id, command) function to app/utils.py. Function should:
  - Validate server is running before executing commands
  - Execute command via process input to the running server
  - Return execution result with success/error status
  - Include input validation and sanitization
  - Log all command executions for security
  - Handle errors gracefully with proper error messages
