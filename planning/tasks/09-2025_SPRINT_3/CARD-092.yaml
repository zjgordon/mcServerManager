notes: |
  **Problem**: Console API endpoints are not functioning correctly in tests, with command execution and log retrieval failing unexpectedly.
  
  **Root Cause**: The console API endpoints may have issues with command execution logic, log file handling, or response formatting that are causing tests to fail.
  
  **Affected Tests**:
  - `test_console_command_execution_integration` (expects 200, gets 400)
  - `test_get_server_logs_file_not_found` (expects 0, gets 3)
  - `test_send_console_command_success` (expects True, gets False)
  - `test_execute_server_command_success` (expects True, gets False)
  
  **Actions Required**:
  1. Review console API endpoint implementations in console_routes.py
  2. Fix command execution logic to properly handle success cases
  3. Ensure log file handling works correctly in test environment
  4. Verify response formatting matches test expectations
  5. Check that server status and process verification work correctly
  
  **Files to Examine**:
  - app/routes/api/console_routes.py (all endpoint functions)
  - tests/unit/test_server_management.py (console API tests)
  - tests/integration/test_server_management.py (integration tests)
  - app/utils.py (command execution functions)
  
  **Functionality Issues**:
  - Command execution not returning success when expected
  - Log file handling may have path or permission issues
  - Server status verification may be failing
  - Response format inconsistencies
