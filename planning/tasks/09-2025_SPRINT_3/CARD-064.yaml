notes: |
  Create app/static/js/admin_config.js with JavaScript functionality for experimental 
  features: AJAX calls to toggle features, real-time UI updates, confirmation dialogs 
  for experimental features, error handling, and user feedback. Include debouncing 
  to prevent rapid-fire API calls.
