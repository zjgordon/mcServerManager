notes: |
  Create get_system_memory_for_admin() function in app/utils.py that extracts and formats 
  system memory data specifically for the admin configuration page. This function should 
  leverage the existing get_system_metrics() function from app/monitoring.py and return 
  a dictionary with total system memory, used memory, available memory, and percentages 
  formatted for display in the memory bar gauge.
