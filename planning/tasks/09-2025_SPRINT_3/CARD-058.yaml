  Add ExperimentalFeature model to app/models.py with fields: id, feature_key, feature_name, 
  description, enabled, is_stable, created_at, updated_at, updated_by. Include proper 
  validation methods and constraints. This model will store experimental feature toggles 
  and metadata for the feature gating system.
