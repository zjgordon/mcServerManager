  Add utility functions to app/utils.py for experimental feature management: 
  get_experimental_features(), toggle_experimental_feature(feature_key, enabled), 
  is_feature_enabled(feature_key), and add_experimental_feature(). These functions 
  will handle database operations for the feature gating system.
