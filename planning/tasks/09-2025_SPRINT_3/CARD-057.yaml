  Add CSS styling for the memory bar gauge component. Create classes for 
  .memory-gauge-container, .memory-gauge-bar, .memory-gauge-used, and .memory-gauge-labels. 
  Implement color-coded indicators (green to yellow to red based on usage percentage), 
  responsive design matching existing UI, and proper spacing and typography.
