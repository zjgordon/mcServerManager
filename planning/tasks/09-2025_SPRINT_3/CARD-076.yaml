notes: |
  Update app/templates/home.html to conditionally show "Manage Server" button instead of "Console" 
  button when server_management_page feature is enabled. Use is_feature_enabled('server_management_page') 
  check. Keep existing console button as fallback when feature is disabled. Update both table view 
  (line 230) and card view (line 341) console buttons.
