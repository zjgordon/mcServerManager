  Create app/templates/server_management.html extending base.html. Include four main sections:
  1) Server Information (name, version, port, memory, config options, status, owner info for admins)
  2) Server Controls (start/stop, copy link, manage backups, delete server)
  3) Real-Time Console (log display area, controls for refresh/clear/download)
  4) Server Commands (pre-defined command buttons, custom command input, command history)
  Use consistent styling with existing design system and ensure mobile responsiveness.
