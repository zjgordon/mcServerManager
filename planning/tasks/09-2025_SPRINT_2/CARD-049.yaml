  Fix test failures in:
  - tests/integration/test_backup_api.py::TestBackupAPI::test_server_access_control
  - tests/e2e/test_backup_workflows.py::TestBackupWorkflows::test_backup_workflow_with_user_permissions
  
  Issue: Tests expect 403 (Forbidden) but getting 404 (Not Found)
  Root cause: Recent fix changed @admin_required_api to @user_or_admin_required_api
  but tests still expect admin-only behavior. Need to update test expectations
  to match new access control model where regular users can access their own servers.
