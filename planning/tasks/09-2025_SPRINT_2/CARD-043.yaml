acceptance:
  - Update table/card backup route to use backup scheduler naming convention
  - Change backup filename from {server_name}_{timestamp}.tar.gz to {server_name}_backup_{timestamp}.tar.gz
  - Ensure backup management page can find backups created by table/card buttons
  - Test that both interfaces create backups with consistent naming
  - Update planning/meta/PROJECT_HISTORY.md with log entry
  - Update meta/PROJECT_STATUS.md with one-liner
  - Commit follows Conventional Commits with [CARD-043]
artifacts:
  - app/routes/server_routes.py
notes: |
  Current discrepancy: Table/card backup buttons create files named {server_name}_{timestamp}.tar.gz
  while backup management expects {server_name}_backup_{timestamp}.tar.gz. This causes backups
  created via table/card buttons to not appear in the backup management history.
  
  Solution: Update the backup_server() function in server_routes.py to use the same naming
  convention as the backup scheduler (line 829).
