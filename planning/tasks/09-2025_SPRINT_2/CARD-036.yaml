notes: |
  Add configurable compression and encryption options for backup files to optimize storage and security.
  
  Compression Options:
  - gzip (fast, moderate compression)
  - bzip2 (slower, better compression)
  - lzma (slowest, best compression)
  - No compression (fastest, largest files)
  
  Encryption Options:
  - AES-256 encryption
  - Configurable encryption keys
  - Optional password-based encryption
  - Key management and rotation
