  - POST   /api/backups/schedules              # Create new schedule
  - GET    /api/backups/schedules/<server_id>  # Get schedule for server
  - PUT    /api/backups/schedules/<server_id>  # Update schedule
  - DELETE /api/backups/schedules/<server_id>  # Delete schedule
  - POST   /api/backups/<server_id>/trigger    # Manual backup trigger
  - GET    /api/backups/<server_id>/history    # Backup history
  - GET    /api/backups/<server_id>/status     # Backup status
