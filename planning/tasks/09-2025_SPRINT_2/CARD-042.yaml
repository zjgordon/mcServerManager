notes: |
  The backup trigger button fails with "JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1" 
  when the server returns HTML error pages instead of JSON. Need to add content-type checking
  and proper error handling in the triggerManualBackup() method before calling response.json().
  
  Current issue: JavaScript expects JSON but may receive HTML error pages (500 errors) or 
  empty responses from the backup trigger API endpoint.
