  Enhance test infrastructure to support all test scenarios:
  - Create proper server file fixtures (server.jar, world files, etc.)
  - Improve temporary directory management in tests
  - Add proper Flask application context setup for all tests
  - Create mock objects for external dependencies
  - Ensure test isolation and cleanup
  
  This card addresses the underlying infrastructure issues that cause
  many test failures due to missing files, improper context, and
  inadequate test setup.
