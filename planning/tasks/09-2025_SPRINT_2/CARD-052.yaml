  Fix backup verification test failures:
  - test_generate_backup_quality_score_fair: assert 'Excellent' in ['Fair', 'Good']
  - test_verify_backup_comprehensive_with_restore_test: assert False is True
  - test_backup_restore: ERROR (not detailed in output)
  
  Root causes:
  1. Quality score calculation returning wrong quality level
  2. Comprehensive backup verification failing
  3. Backup restore functionality not working in tests
  4. Quality scoring thresholds may be incorrect
