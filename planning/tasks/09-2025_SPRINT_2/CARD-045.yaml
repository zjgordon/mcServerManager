notes: |
  Current issue: The backup history API only looks for files matching {server_name}_backup_*
  pattern, so it doesn't find backups created with the old {server_name}_{timestamp}.tar.gz
  naming convention.
  
  Solution: Update the _get_backup_files() method in backup_scheduler.py (line 1194) to
  recognize both naming patterns for backward compatibility with existing backups.
