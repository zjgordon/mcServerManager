acceptance:
  - Replace custom tar.gz creation in backup_server() with backup_scheduler.execute_backup_job()
  - Remove duplicate backup creation logic from server_routes.py
  - Ensure table/card backups use same robust verification and compression as management interface
  - Test that both interfaces produce identical backup quality and metadata
  - Update planning/meta/PROJECT_HISTORY.md with log entry
  - Update meta/PROJECT_STATUS.md with one-liner
  - Commit follows Conventional Commits with [CARD-044]
artifacts:
  - app/routes/server_routes.py
notes: |
  Current issue: Table/card backup buttons use simple tarfile.open() while backup management
  uses comprehensive backup_scheduler.execute_backup_job() with verification, compression,
  and metadata. This creates inconsistent backup quality and functionality.
  
  Solution: Replace the custom backup creation logic in backup_server() function (lines 832-839)
  with a call to backup_scheduler.execute_backup_job(server_id) to unify the implementation.
